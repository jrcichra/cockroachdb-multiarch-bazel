# cockroachdb-multiarch-bazel
Actions for building a multi-arch cockroachdb binaries / containers

Deploy cockroachdb in an all arm64 or arm64/amd64 mixed Kubernetes cluster.

# NOTE 12/5/2022
Cockroach Labs now has experimental support for ARM64: https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/releases/v22.2 - therefore I don't plan on updating this image - instead use the official experimental builds.
